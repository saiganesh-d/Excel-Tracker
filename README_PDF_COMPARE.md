# üìÑ PDF Structure Comparison Tool - User Guide

## Overview

The PDF Structure Comparison tool intelligently compares PDF documents by analyzing their hierarchical structure (chapters, sections, subsections) rather than just comparing text line-by-line. This makes it perfect for analyzing supplier modifications to requirement documents, security guidelines, and policy documents.

## Key Features

### üéØ Intelligent Section Matching
- **Handles reordering**: Sections can be moved without being flagged as "removed"
- **Semantic matching**: Uses title and content similarity to match sections
- **Hierarchy awareness**: Understands document structure (Chapter 1 > Section 1.1 > Subsection 1.1.1)

### üìä Change Detection
- **Modified**: Content changes within existing sections
- **Added**: New sections added by supplier
- **Removed**: Sections deleted from original
- **Reordered**: Sections moved to different positions
- **Unchanged**: Sections with no changes

### üîç Critical Keyword Highlighting
- Define keywords like "security", "mandatory", "shall", "must"
- Automatically flags sections containing these keywords
- Ensures critical compliance sections aren't missed

### üìë Multiple View Modes
1. **Structured Overview**: Hierarchical view with expandable sections
2. **Side-by-Side**: Compare original and modified content directly
3. **Change List Only**: Compact view of just the changes
4. **Summary Dashboard**: Statistical analysis with charts

### üíæ Export Options
- **Text Report**: Human-readable change summary
- **Excel Summary**: Spreadsheet with all changes and statistics
- **JSON**: Machine-readable format for integration

## How It Works

### 1. Document Parsing

The tool extracts document structure by identifying:

- **Chapter headings**: "1. Introduction", "CHAPTER 1", etc.
- **Section numbering**: "1.1 Overview", "1.2.3 Details"
- **Letter-based sections**: "A. Section", "a) Subsection"
- **Roman numerals**: "I. First Section", "ii. Subsection"
- **Title case headings**: Short lines in title case

### 2. Intelligent Matching

For each section in the original document, the tool:

1. Calculates similarity scores with all sections in modified document
2. Considers:
   - Title similarity (60% weight)
   - Content similarity (30% weight)
   - Hierarchy level match (10% weight)
3. Matches sections with >60% similarity score
4. Detects if matched section moved (reordering)

### 3. Content Comparison

For matched sections, performs line-by-line diff to show:
- Text additions (green highlight)
- Text deletions (red strikethrough)
- Text modifications (yellow highlight)

## Use Cases

### 1. Requirement Document Analysis

**Scenario**: You send a 50-page requirement document to a supplier. They return a modified version.

**What the tool does:**
- Identifies which requirements were modified
- Flags if critical requirements were removed
- Shows if supplier added new requirements
- Detects if sections were reordered

**Time saved**: Hours of manual comparison reduced to minutes

### 2. Security Guideline Review

**Scenario**: Supplier must follow security guidelines but may customize for their environment.

**What the tool does:**
- Highlights changes to security controls
- Flags removal of mandatory security measures
- Shows added security sections
- Critical keyword flagging ensures nothing is missed

### 3. Contract Modification Tracking

**Scenario**: Contract template sent to supplier, returned with modifications.

**What the tool does:**
- Tracks all textual changes
- Identifies removed clauses
- Shows added terms
- Provides audit trail for legal review

### 4. Policy Document Updates

**Scenario**: Comparing two versions of company policy documents.

**What the tool does:**
- Shows structural changes (reorganization)
- Highlights content modifications
- Identifies removed/added policies
- Generates change report for stakeholders

## Understanding the Output

### Change Type Badges

- üü° **MODIFIED**: Section exists in both but content changed
- üü¢ **ADDED**: New section in modified document
- üî¥ **REMOVED**: Section deleted from original
- üîµ **REORDERED**: Section moved to different position
- ‚ö™ **UNCHANGED**: No changes detected

### Match Scores

- **95-100%**: Nearly identical (only minor changes)
- **75-94%**: Strong match (some content modified)
- **60-74%**: Moderate match (significant changes)
- **<60%**: Sections don't match well

### Hierarchy Levels

- **Level 1**: Chapters (e.g., "1. Introduction")
- **Level 2**: Sections (e.g., "1.1 Overview")
- **Level 3**: Subsections (e.g., "1.1.1 Details")
- **Level 4+**: Sub-subsections and deeper

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Document Preparation

- ‚úÖ Use consistent heading styles in your templates
- ‚úÖ Use numbered sections (1.1, 1.2, etc.) for best matching
- ‚úÖ Keep heading text clear and descriptive
- ‚ùå Avoid overly complex formatting

### 2. Critical Keywords

**Good keywords:**
- "shall" - indicates mandatory requirements
- "must" - indicates obligations
- "security" - security-related content
- "compliance" - regulatory requirements
- "mandatory" - required elements

**Add domain-specific keywords:**
- For finance docs: "audit", "financial", "reporting"
- For technical docs: "API", "authentication", "encryption"
- For HR docs: "confidential", "privacy", "personal data"

### 3. Review Strategy

1. **Start with Summary Dashboard**: Get overall picture
2. **Check Critical Changes**: Review üî¥ flagged sections first
3. **Review Removed Sections**: Ensure nothing important was deleted
4. **Check Reordered**: Verify structural changes make sense
5. **Review Modified**: Analyze content changes in detail

### 4. Export Strategy

- **Text Report**: For email summaries and quick reference
- **Excel Summary**: For detailed analysis and team collaboration
- **JSON**: For integration with other systems or automation

## Limitations & Workarounds

### Current Limitations

1. **Image-based PDFs**: Tool requires text-based PDFs
   - **Workaround**: Use OCR software to convert images to text first

2. **Complex Tables**: Multi-column tables may not parse perfectly
   - **Workaround**: Review these sections manually

3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Documents without clear heading structure
   - **Workaround**: Standardize templates before sending to suppliers

4. **Very Large PDFs**: Documents >500 pages may be slow
   - **Workaround**: Split into logical sections and compare separately

### Supported Heading Patterns

The tool recognizes:
- Numbered: "1.", "1.1", "1.1.1", "1.1.1.1"
- Lettered: "A.", "a)", "B."
- Roman: "I.", "ii.", "III."
- ALL CAPS short lines
- Title Case short lines

## Troubleshooting

### "No sections detected"

**Cause**: Document doesn't have recognizable heading structure

**Solutions**:
- Check if PDF is text-based (not image)
- Verify headings are formatted consistently
- Try adding clearer numbering to headings

### "Too many false matches"

**Cause**: Sections are very similar or generic

**Solutions**:
- Use more descriptive section titles
- Add more specific content to sections
- Review match scores (low scores indicate uncertain matches)

### "Critical sections not flagged"

**Cause**: Keywords don't match your document terminology

**Solutions**:
- Review critical sections manually
- Add more keywords specific to your domain
- Check spelling of keywords

## Advanced Features

### Customizing Heading Detection

Edit `pdf_compare.py` line ~58-75 to add custom patterns:

```python
self.heading_patterns = [
    (r'^YOUR_PATTERN_HERE', level),
    # Add custom patterns for your document format
]
```
